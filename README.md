## 💡 Why This Exists

Every professional maintains the same information scattered across dozens of places: a Word document, a Google Doc "updated" version, a PDF you emailed last year, a LinkedIn profile that's slightly different, a version tailored for that one job you applied to in 2023. Every time you need a CV, you open whichever file you find first, realize it's outdated, copy-paste from another version, reformat, adjust, and inevitably lose track of what's current.

**The problem isn't writing a CV. It's that you don't have a single source of truth.**

Think about it: your professional history — your experience, skills, education, projects — is *one* dataset. It doesn't change depending on where you apply. What changes is *which parts you highlight* and *how you present them*. But instead of maintaining one canonical record and generating tailored views from it, we've been maintaining dozens of divergent copies. It's the same mistake as copying a database instead of querying it.

### The obvious solution (once you see it)

1. **One knowledge base.** You maintain a single, complete, structured record of everything: every role, every skill, every project, every certification. This is your source of truth. You update it once, and it's always current.

2. **Generate, don't duplicate.** When you need a CV for a specific job, you don't copy and edit — you *generate* an optimized version from your complete data. The AI reads the job description, selects the most relevant experience, emphasizes the right skills, and adjusts the tone. The output is a tailored CV. Your source data stays untouched.

3. **Templates and formatting are separate concerns.** Your content shouldn't be locked into a format. Want a minimal single-column layout today and a sidebar layout tomorrow? Switch. Want a different color palette for a creative role vs. a corporate one? Switch. The data doesn't care about the presentation.

4. **AI assists, you decide.** The AI can draft, suggest, and optimize — but you always have the final word. Review every change, edit any detail, tweak the wording until it feels right. Run multiple iterations until you're satisfied. Or skip AI entirely and write everything yourself — the editor, templates, and export work perfectly without it. The tool adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.

5. **Your data stays yours.** Everything lives in your browser. No accounts, no cloud sync, no vendor lock-in. Export your data as JSON anytime. If you run CV Generator yourself, the AI can be a local model through Ollama, and then your professional history never leaves your machine.

This is what CV Generator does. It's not a "prettier resume template" — it's the workflow that makes maintaining and tailoring your CV a solved problem instead of a recurring chore.

## � Deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

This project is configured for deployment on **Cloudflare Workers** using [`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare).

### Prerequisites

- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed (`npm i -g wrangler`)
- A Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- Authenticated via `wrangler login`

### Configuration files

| File                  | Purpose                                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `wrangler.jsonc`      | Cloudflare Workers config (name, compatibility, assets)                       |
| `open-next.config.ts` | OpenNext adapter — sets `buildCommand: "pnpm build"` and R2 incremental cache |
| `.env.production`     | Production env vars (built into the bundle at build time)                     |
| `.env.example`        | Template for local `.env` — copy and adjust                                   |

### Environment Variables

| Variable                     | Values                      | Default  | Description                                                               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_THEME`  | `light` · `dark` · `modern` | `modern` | Default UI theme                                                          |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_OLLAMA` | `true` · `false`            | `false`  | Disable Ollama provider (set `true` in production — Ollama is local only) |

### Build & Deploy

```bash
# 1. Stub @vercel/og files to stay under the 3 MiB free-tier bundle limit
for f in node_modules/.pnpm/next@16.*/node_modules/next/dist/compiled/@vercel/og/{resvg.wasm,yoga.wasm,index.edge.js}; do
  echo "// stub" > "$f"
done

# 2. Build for Cloudflare Workers
pnpm build:cf

# 3. Deploy
pnpm deploy:cf
```

Or as a one-liner:

```bash
for f in node_modules/.pnpm/next@16.*/node_modules/next/dist/compiled/@vercel/og/{resvg.wasm,yoga.wasm,index.edge.js}; do echo "// stub" > "$f"; done && pnpm build:cf && pnpm deploy:cf
```

### Local Preview (Cloudflare)

```bash
pnpm preview:cf
```

> **Note:** The `@vercel/og` stubs are lost after every `pnpm install`. You must re-stub before each build.  
> The `.env*` files are gitignored — never commit secrets. Use `.env.example` as a reference.

## �📋 FAQ

Common questions are answered in the app's built-in FAQ section (click **FAQ** in the sidebar).

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this without AI?</strong></summary>

Yes! The editor, templates, palettes, layouts, and export work completely independently. AI is optional — useful for tailoring your CV to specific job descriptions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data sent to any server?</strong></summary>

Your CV data is stored only in your browser (localStorage); no server keeps a copy. When you generate (or import a LinkedIn PDF), the data goes through the app's own API route to the AI provider you chose. If you run CV Generator yourself with Ollama, it never leaves your machine. The site counts anonymous visits with cookieless Google Analytics, which never receives anything from your CV. Details in the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I export to PDF?</strong></summary>

Use the print button in the preview panel → your browser's print dialog opens → select "Save as PDF". The output faithfully reproduces the preview with all colors and formatting.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I generate my CV in a different language?</strong></summary>

Yes! In the Generate panel, select an output language before generating. The AI will translate all content (summary, descriptions, achievements, skill categories) to your chosen language while preserving proper nouns like company names, institutions, and technologies. You can also set it to "Auto" to keep the same language as your input data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I add my own templates?</strong></summary>

Yes! Add a new entry to the `TEMPLATES` array in `lib/cv-store.tsx` and a matching style definition in `getTemplateStyles()` in `components/panels/preview-panel.tsx`.
</details>

## � AI Disclaimer

This project was built with the assistance of AI tools. I used [v0](https://v0.dev) for an initial mockup and then refined the entire codebase with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), switching between models depending on task complexity.

I acted as **product owner, project manager, and developer** throughout the process — defining features, breaking down tasks, reviewing every output, and programming alongside the AI agents.

> **AI amplifies you, but creativity, asking the right questions, and discovering the right problem to solve — that's something only you can do.**

Keep coding. 🚀
